`hypredrive` is an open source project distributed under the terms of the MIT license. All
new contributions must be made under this license. We welcome contributions via pull
requests as well as questions, feature requests, or bug reports via issues. Contact our
team at https://github.com/hypre-space/hypredrive with any questions.

If you aren't a contributor/developer at hypre-space, you won't have permission to push
new branches to the repository. First, you should create a fork. This will create your
copy of the `hypredrive` repository and ensure you can push your changes up to GitHub and
create PRs.

1. Create your branches off the `hypredrive:master` branch.
2. Clearly name your branches, commits, and PRs as this will help us manage queued work in a timely manner.
3. Articulate your commit messages in the imperative (e.g., Adds new privacy policy link to README).
4. Commit your work in logically organized commits, and group commits together logically in a PR.
5. Title each PR clearly and give it an unambiguous description.
6. Review existing issues before opening a new one. Your issue might already be under
   development or discussed by others. Feel free to add to any outstanding issue/bug.
7. Be explicit when opening issues and reporting bugs. What behavior are you expecting?
   What is your justification or use case for the new feature/enhancement? How can the bug
   be recreated? What are any environment variables to consider?
