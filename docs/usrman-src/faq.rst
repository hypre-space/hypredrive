================================

This section provides answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about `hypredrive`.

What is `hypredrive`?
---------------------

`hypredrive` is a high-level interface for solving linear systems with hypre.

How do I install `hypredrive`?
------------------------------

You can install `hypredrive` by downloading and compiling its source files. Please refer to
:ref:`Installation` for detailed installation instructions.

Which linear system types can `hypredrive` solve?
-------------------------------------------------

`hypredrive` is capable of solving both symmetric and non-symmetric sparse linear
systems. The specific capabilities depend on the underlying HYPRE library and the
configuration of `hypredrive`.

How do I configure `hypredrive` for my specific problem?
--------------------------------------------------------

You can configure `hypredrive` by creating a YAML configuration file. This file specifies
all necessary settings, including the linear system, solver, and preconditioner
configurations. For more information, see the :ref:`InputFileStructure`. For examples of
input files, see :ref:`Examples`.
