# hypredrive documentation

In this folder, you can find hypredrive's user and developer manuals in PDF format.

These documents can be generated by running `make docs` from the top-level directory.

## Building the user's manual in HTML format

The HTML version of the documentation provides a better interactivity and navigation
experience than the PDF version.

To build the documentation in HTML format locally, it is necessary to have `sphinx`
installed in your machine. The build process is simple and can be accomplished by running
`make html` from this folder. Then, the output will be located at
`usrman-build/html/index.html`, which can be opened by your preferred browser.
